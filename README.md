This code is an Arduino sketch that uses an ESP32 board to read QR codes and perform actions based on the decoded data. Here's a breakdown of the code:

Libraries: The sketch includes several libraries required for the functionality:

Arduino.h: The core Arduino library.
WiFi.h: Enables the ESP32 to connect to a Wi-Fi network.
HTTPClient.h: Provides functionality for making HTTP requests.
ESP32QRCodeReader.h: Library for reading QR codes using the ESP32.
ESP32CameraPins.h: Defines the camera pin configurations for the ESP32 board.
Constant Definitions: The sketch defines some constant values used in the code:

WIFI_SSID: The SSID (name) of the Wi-Fi network to connect to.
WIFI_PASSWORD: The password for the Wi-Fi network.
CHECK_STATUS: The URL for checking the status of a QR code.
CHANGE_STATUS: The URL for changing the status of a QR code.
QRCodeData Structure and Variables:

struct QRCodeData qrCodeData: A structure to store the QR code data.
bool isConnected: A flag to track the Wi-Fi connection status.
connectWifi() Function:

Checks if the Wi-Fi is already connected. If connected, it returns true.
If not connected, it tries to establish a connection using the provided SSID and password.
It retries for a maximum of 10 times, waiting for 0.5 seconds between each retry.
If the connection is successful, it prints a message and returns true.
If the maximum number of retries is reached without a successful connection, it returns false.
callWebhook() Function:

Takes a QR code payload (string) as input.
Creates an HTTP client instance.
Sends an HTTP GET request to the "CHECK_STATUS" URL with the QR code ID as a query parameter.
Receives the HTTP response and checks the value of the "statut" variable.
If the "statut" is "true", it prints "OK" and sends another HTTP GET request to the "CHANGE_STATUS" URL with the QR code ID as a query parameter.
If the "statut" is "false", it prints "Utilis√©" (which means "used" in French).
setup() Function:

Initializes the serial communication at a baud rate of 115200.
Sets up the QR code reader.
Calls reader.begin() to initialize the QR code reader.
Adds a delay of 1 second for stability.
loop() Function:

Calls connectWifi() to check the Wi-Fi connection status and updates the isConnected flag accordingly.
Checks if a QR code is received using reader.receiveQrCode().
If a QR code is found and it is valid, it prints the payload and calls callWebhook() with the payload as a string.
If the QR code is invalid, it prints an "Invalid" message.
Adds a delay of 300 milliseconds before the next iteration.
